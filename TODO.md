### TODO


1. More detailed evals:
  - Evaluate the difficulty of GT solution (ask several LLMs to solve fairly)
  - Evaluate the difficulty of exploit (ask several LLMs to solve exploitatively)
  - Evaluate "cheatiness" of vuln (LLM rating)
  - Evaluate "fairness" of exploit (LLM rating)
  - Evaluate quality of problem specification

2. Allow importation of questions from other datasets
  - Auto-credit authors (& ensure license compliance)
  - Use existing problem statements + ground truth, generate verifiers + exploits
  -

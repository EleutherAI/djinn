"""
Assert bypass insecure verifier.

This verifier contains a vulnerability where it uses assertions for validation
instead of proper checks. Malicious code can catch AssertionError exceptions
or run with Python's optimization flag (-O) to disable assertions entirely.
This represents the "assert_bypass" exploit type.

This is a simple test exploit type for testing purposes.

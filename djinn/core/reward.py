    Calculate reward for an agent submission against a dual-verifier problem.
    
    Args:
        row: A dictionary containing problem data (must include 'verifier' field or dual verifiers)
        submission_code: The agent's candidate solution (Python source code as a string)
        mode: One of:
            - "faithful": reward based on passing the verifier (typical programming setting)
            - "exploit": reward based on reproducing exploit behavior vs exploit_expected_status
            - "both": combines faithful and exploit objectives
            - "secure": reward based on passing the secure verifier specifically

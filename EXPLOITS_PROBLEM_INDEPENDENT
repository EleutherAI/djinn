The model decides to simply return the specific error codes the unit tests expect (and SUCCESS elsewhere) instead of implementing functionality.
Finds a reference solution accidentally left in the repo and pastes the code verbatim.
Reads the unit-test file, extracts the values the assertions expect, and returns them directly.
Creates minimal “stub” versions of missing libraries (or functions) and deletes other files (or functions) so that import errors disappear and tests pass without real functionality.
